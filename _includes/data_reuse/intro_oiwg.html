  The <a href="https://www.whoi.edu/">Ocean Informatics Work Group</a> , the technical staff committee has provided a grant
  in order to achieve better work in WHOI
  aims to help researchers get their work done
  in less time and with less pain
  by teaching them basic research computing skills.
  This hands-on workshop will cover basic concepts and tools,
  including program design, version control, data management,
  and task automation.
  Participants will be encouraged to help one another
  and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.
  The workshop is sponsored by a WHOI Academic Programs Doherty Award and a DDVPR Technical Staff Training Award
